# Automated Accessibility Improvements

This PR contains accessibility improvements generated by the Gemini CLI based on guidelines in `access-info.md`.

## Changes Made

- **Dashboard.svelte**:
  - Added `aria-label="Resize panels"` to the `PaneResizer` component to provide an accessible name for screen reader users, clarifying its function.
  - Added `aria-hidden="true"` to the decorative `div` inside the `PaneResizer` to prevent screen readers from announcing a non-interactive, purely visual element.

## Files Modified

- `src/lib/components/Dashboard.svelte`

## Further changes to make

- The `paneforge` library should be reviewed to ensure its components (`PaneResizer`, `PaneGroup`, `Pane`) are fully keyboard accessible and manage focus appropriately during interaction. This automated change adds ARIA attributes, but cannot verify keyboard behavior.

Ready for review! ðŸš€
