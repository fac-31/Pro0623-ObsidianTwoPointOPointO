# Automated Accessibility Improvements

This PR contains accessibility improvements generated by the Gemini CLI based on guidelines in `access-info.md`.

## Changes Made

- In `src/lib/components/InfoPanel.svelte`, added a `<label>` to the tab dropdown to ensure it has an accessible name. This links the visual "Tab:" text to the select input, improving screen reader usability.
- In `src/lib/components/QueryPanel.svelte`, the query input area was updated for better accessibility and semantics:
  - Wrapped the `textarea` and `button` in a `<form>` element to handle submission.
  - Added a visually hidden `<label>` for the `textarea` to provide an accessible name for screen readers.
  - Changed the submission trigger from `on:click` on the button to `on:submit` on the form, with the button type set to `submit`. This follows standard HTML practices and improves keyboard accessibility.
- In `src/lib/components/SearchBar.svelte`, the search input was updated for better accessibility:
  - Added a visually hidden `<label>` to provide an accessible name for the search input, instead of relying on the placeholder.
  - Explicitly linked the `<label>` to the `<input>` using `for` and `id` attributes.
  - Added `aria-hidden="true"` to the decorative SVG icon to hide it from screen readers.
  - Added a `name` attribute to the input field.
- In `src/lib/components/Tabs.svelte`, the tab component was updated to be more accessible:
  - Added `aria-selected` to indicate the active tab to screen readers.
  - Added `tabindex` to manage focus; only the active tab is in the natural tab order.
  - Implemented keyboard navigation using `ArrowLeft` and `ArrowRight` keys to switch between tabs.
  - Added `aria-controls` to associate each tab with its corresponding (future) tab panel.
  - Added a more descriptive `aria-label` to the close button for each tab.
  - Added an `aria-label` to the `tablist` itself for better screen reader context.
  - Implemented focus management to ensure the newly selected tab receives focus.
- In `src/lib/components/WorldView.svelte`, the component was updated to improve landmark and live region accessibility:
  - Added `role="region"` and `aria-label="World view"` to the main container `div` to define it as a landmark for better screen reader navigation.
  - Added `aria-live="polite"` to the `div` that wraps the dynamic `GraphView` and `TextView` components. This will announce to screen readers when the view is updated, improving awareness of on-screen changes.
- In `src/routes/+page.svelte`:
  - **Explicit Form Labels**: Added `for` and `id` attributes to connect labels with their corresponding inputs in the "Add New User" and "Delete User" forms. This improves screen reader compatibility.
  - **Dynamic Content Announcements**: Added `role="alert"` to the error message paragraph to ensure errors are announced by screen readers. Added `role="status"` and `aria-live="polite"` to the new user creation confirmation message so users are notified of the successful action.
  - **Svelte Event Handlers**: Replaced legacy `onclick` and `onsubmit` attributes with Svelte's `on:click` and `on:submit|preventDefault` for better consistency and to prevent default form submission behavior.
- In `src/routes/auth/+page.svelte`:
  - Added a dynamic `<svelte:head>` to provide a unique page title for the "Log In" and "Sign Up" states. This is crucial for screen reader users and improves SEO (WCAG 2.4.2 Page Titled).
  - Corrected the Svelte event handler syntax from `onclick` to `on:click` for the form-toggling buttons, ensuring they function correctly within the Svelte framework.
  - Removed the redundant `cursor-pointer` CSS class from the `<button>` elements as a minor code cleanup.

## Files Modified

- `src/lib/components/InfoPanel.svelte`
- `src/lib/components/QueryPanel.svelte`
- `src/lib/components/SearchBar.svelte`
- `src/lib/components/Tabs.svelte`
- `src/lib/components/WorldView.svelte`
- `src/routes/+page.svelte`
- `src/routes/auth/+page.svelte`

## Further changes to make

- The search icon in `SearchBar.svelte` uses `opacity-50`, which may not meet WCAG color contrast requirements. This should be manually reviewed and adjusted if necessary.
- In `src/routes/auth/+page.svelte`, the page uses `text-black`. We need to verify this has sufficient contrast against the background color across the application to meet WCAG 1.4.3 Contrast (Minimum).
- When the form view is toggled between "Log In" and "Sign Up" in `src/routes/auth/+page.svelte`, the change is not announced to screen readers. Consider wrapping the dynamic content in a region with `aria-live="polite"` to announce the update.
- Focus is not managed when the form view changes in `src/routes/auth/+page.svelte`. After toggling, focus should be programmatically moved to the new form's heading or first field to provide a seamless experience for keyboard users.
